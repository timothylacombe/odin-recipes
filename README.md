first html project for TOP

This project served to put into practice the basics of creating html pages, linking pages and images,
some basic tags such as headers, paragraphs, and both unordered and ordered lists. It also exercised
the new github skills 'git clone', 'git add', 'git commit', 'git push', 'git status', 'git log' as well
as making good commit messages and committing often.
