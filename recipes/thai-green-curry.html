        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 cup uncooked jasmine rice</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, cut into wedges</li>
            <li>2 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground ginger</li>
            <li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 lb chicken tenders, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>1 tbsp green curry paste, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>1 eggplant, cut into 1-in cubes</li>
            <li>22 oz chicken broth, or more to taste</li>
            <li>15 oz can light coconut milk</li>
            <li>8 oz can bamboo shoots</li>
            <li>2 tsp lime juice</li>
            <li>1 small bunch fresh basil leaves, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover,
                 and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Mix in onion, fish
                sauce, brown sugar, ginger, and garlic; cook and stir about 5 minutes. Add
                chicken, curry paste, and basil. Cook, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes
                more. Add eggplant, cover, and reduce heat to low to avoid burning spices.
                Cook about 5 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Pour broth, coconut milk, and bamboo shoots into the saucepan. Continue
                cooking until eggplant is tender and curry is heated through, 5 to 10
                minutes more. Stir in lime juice before serving over cooked rice with basil
                leaves.</li>
        </ol>
